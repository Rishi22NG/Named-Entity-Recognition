# Named-Entity-Recognition
�
� Objective: 
To build a custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) model that extracts 
specific types of entities such as names, organizations, dates, or locations from a 
text corpus. This project reinforces NLP annotation and custom model training. 
�
� Project Overview: 
This NER system processes unstructured text and highlights named entities 
using rules or pre-trained models. It can be extended to custom entity types for 
use cases like resume parsing, legal text extraction, etc. 
�
� Project Features: 
Load and annotate text data 
Train or fine-tune a named entity recognizer 
Extract and highlight entities in text 
Display entity counts and entity types 
Optional: Save outputs in structured format (JSON/CSV) 
Project Phases: 
�
� Phase 1: Setup 
Import spaCy or nltk 
Prepare or load annotated text 
�
� Phase 2: NER Implementation 
Use pre-trained model or train custom NER pipeline 
Extract entities from new text input 
�
� Phase 3: Evaluation and Output 
Display extracted entities with type labels 
Visualize entity frequencies with bar chart
